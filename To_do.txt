1. Get team's current WAR by active roster (did this, need to see if it works)
    1. Need to fix to make sure we're loading all players (think I fixed this)
    2. Now, need to make sure it works downstream  
        i. Mainly, adjusted WAR table for today's games. Issue is with accents: potential solution in get_starting_rotations
2. Create function for team's winning percentage
    1. As season goes on, need to adjust for current run differential, current cluster luck 
3. Change historical WAR to get from BP instead of Fangraphs
    1. Just need to check to see if this still works downstream
4. Fix what folders every team is in
5. Create final configuration
    1. Things we need to do once vs. daily
    2. What our daily output will look like
    3. Need to save results in some way where we have data on performance
    4. How to incorporate the other models we've scraped?
