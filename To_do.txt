1. Get team's current WAR by active roster
    1. Need to fix to make sure we're loading all players (think I fixed this)
    2. Now, need to make sure it works downstream (left off at adjusting active roster)
        i. Mainly, adjusted WAR table for today's games
            i. Issue is with people in starting rotations who haven't played yet b/c 
                they're not in BP table (coded a solution to this)
2. Create function for team's winning percentage
    1. Need to make sure current season WAR is working correctly and compare that WAR to beginning of season WAR
    2. Then, need to merge everything into one table and add SP adjustment
    3. Need to add a frac_season functionality
3. Finish refactoring
4. Fix what folders every file is in
5. Create final configuration
    1. Things we need to do once vs. daily
    2. What our daily output will look like
    3. Need to save results in some way where we have data on performance
    4. How to incorporate the other models we've scraped?
